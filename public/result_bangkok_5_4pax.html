    <h2>Results for 5 Days in BANGKOK (4pax)</h2>    
    <p> The number of places your group can visit in Bangkok in a day depends on various factors such as the locations chosen, their proximity to each other, the mode of transport, time spent at each location and the group's pace.<br/><br/>
        
        <p>Note that Bangkok's traffic is infamous for its congestion, especially during peak hours. The city experiences heavy traffic throughout the day, but it tends to be particularly intense during morning and evening rush hours. Traffic jams are common on major roads and highways, and it's not uncommon for travel times to be significantly longer than expected.</p> <br/>

        <p>To navigate Bangkok's traffic, it's advisable to plan your travels strategically, avoid peak hours if possible, and consider alternative modes of transportation such as the BTS Skytrain, MRT subway, or boats along the Chao Phraya River when applicable.</p>
        
        <p>It is possible to cover <strong>3-5 places</strong> in 1 day.  That means, you can visit about <mark><strong>20 places in 5 days</strong></mark>. Here are some suggestions (note: the list of places were not ranked in any particular order but a random order for variety):
